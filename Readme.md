# **Transformer-Based Language Model from Scratch**

This project implements a simplified Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using PyTorch. It covers the core components of Transformer architecture, demonstrates pre-training on a text dataset (Harry Potter books), and showcases two fine-tuning strategies: text classification (spam detection) and instruction-based fine-tuning for a personal assistant. The project also includes functionality to load pre-trained GPT-2 weights from OpenAI for faster convergence and improved performance.

## **Project Description**

This repository provides a hands-on guide to understanding and building LLMs. Starting from fundamental concepts like tokenization and embeddings, it progressively constructs a full GPT-like model. Key aspects covered include:

* Word-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization.  
* Positional and token embeddings.  
* Self-attention and Multi-Head Causal Attention mechanisms.  
* Layer Normalization, GELU activation, and Feed-Forward Networks.  
* Shortcut connections (Residual connections).  
* A complete GPT model implementation.

The project demonstrates a full machine learning lifecycle for LLMs, from data preparation to model deployment and evaluation.

## **Features**

* **Modular Transformer Implementation:** Core Transformer components (Multi-Head Attention, Feed-Forward Network, Layer Normalization) are implemented as distinct PyTorch modules for clarity.  
* **Custom Tokenizers:** Includes SimpleTokenizerV1 and SimpleTokenizerV2 for word-based tokenization, along with integration of tiktoken for BPE.  
* **Data Loaders:** Efficient GPTDatasetV1 and DataLoader for preparing sequential text data.  
* **Pre-training Loop:** Basic pre-training setup to learn language patterns.  
* **Text Generation:** Implements greedy decoding, temperature scaling, and Top-K sampling for text generation.  
* **Model Persistence:** Functionality to save and load model weights and optimizer states.  
* **Pre-trained Weights Loading:** Demonstrates how to load official OpenAI GPT-2 (124M) weights into the custom model architecture.  
* **Classification Fine-tuning:** Example of adapting the LLM for binary text classification (spam detection) by adding a custom classification head and freezing base layers.  
* **Instruction-based Fine-tuning:** Shows how to fine-tune the model to follow instructions using a prompt-response format (Alpaca style).  
* **Automated Evaluation:** Utilizes an external LLM (Llama 3 via Ollama) to score generated responses, providing an automated evaluation benchmark.

## **Setup and Installation**

To set up the project, it's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git  
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

3. **Download NLTK data (for some early tokenization examples, if used):**  
   import nltk  
   nltk.download('punkt')  
   nltk.download('wordnet')

4. **For Pre-trained GPT-2 Weights:** The notebook uses a helper script gpt\_download3.py (which will be provided in the repository) to download the weights.  
   * **Note:** The pre-trained weights themselves (.npz files) are large and will be downloaded automatically by the script to a gpt2/ directory.  
5. **For Automated Evaluation with Llama 3 (Optional):**  
   * This part requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to be installed and running locally.  
   * You will also need to pull the Llama 3 model: ollama pull llama3.

## **Dataset**

### **Pre-training Dataset**

* **Harry Potter Books:** The model is pre-trained on the combined text of Harry Potter books, downloaded via kagglehub. The script automatically handles the download.

### **Fine-tuning Datasets**

* **SMS Spam Collection:** For classification fine-tuning, downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Automatically handled by the script.  
* **Instruction Data:** A JSON file for instruction-based fine-tuning, downloaded from the rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch GitHub repository. Automatically handled by the script.

## **Model Architecture**

The core model, GPTModel, is a decoder-only Transformer architecture, consisting of:

* **Token Embeddings:** nn.Embedding for converting token IDs to dense vectors.  
* **Positional Embeddings:** nn.Embedding to encode token positions.  
* **Transformer Blocks:** A sequence of TransformerBlock layers, each containing:  
  * Multi-Head Causal Attention (MultiHeadAttention)  
  * Layer Normalization (LayerNorm)  
  * Feed-Forward Network (FeedForward with GELU activation)  
  * Shortcut (Residual) Connections for stable training.  
* **Final Layer Norm:** For output stabilization.  
* **Output Head:** A linear layer projecting embeddings to vocabulary size for next token prediction.

## **Pre-training**

The pre-training phase trains the model to predict the next token in a sequence, learning fundamental language patterns.

* **Loss Function:** torch.nn.functional.cross\_entropy.  
* **Optimizer:** torch.optim.AdamW.  
* **Training Loop:** Custom train\_model\_simple function with periodic evaluations.  
* **Context Length:** Configurable (e.g., 256 or 1024 tokens).

## **Fine-tuning Strategies**

The project explores two primary fine-tuning approaches:

### **1\. Classification Fine-tuning (Spam Detection)**

* The pre-trained LLM is adapted for binary classification.  
* A new nn.Linear layer is added as a classification head.  
* Specific layers (e.g., the last Transformer block, final LayerNorm, and the new classification head) are unfrozen and trained, while the rest of the model remains frozen.  
* Evaluated using classification accuracy.

### **2\. Instruction-based Fine-tuning (Personal Assistant)**

* The pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned to follow specific instructions.  
* Data is formatted into prompt-response pairs (Stanford Alpaca format).  
* Custom collation function handles padding and masking of instruction tokens to ensure the loss is only computed for the generated response.

## **Evaluation**

* **Pre-training/Instruction Fine-tuning:** Evaluated by tracking training and validation loss, and generating sample text.  
* **Classification Fine-tuning:** Evaluated by training, validation, and test accuracy.  
* **Automated LLM Evaluation:** For instruction-based fine-tuning, an external LLM (Llama 3 via Ollama) is used to score the model's generated responses against correct outputs.

## **Usage**

To run the project, execute the llm\_from\_scratch.py script (or run it as a Colab notebook). Follow the sequential steps, ensuring dependencies are installed and datasets are downloaded/processed as instructed.

## **Scope for Future Improvements**

* **Larger Models:** Experiment with larger custom GPT models (e.g., GPT-medium, large configurations as outlined) or fine-tune more advanced pre-trained models.  
* **Advanced Fine-tuning Techniques:** Explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for more efficient fine-tuning.  
* **More Sophisticated Decoders:** Implement beam search with more advanced scoring functions, or other sampling strategies like Nucleus Sampling (Top-P).  
* **Quantization:** Explore techniques like 8-bit or 4-bit quantization for faster inference and reduced memory footprint.  
* **Deployment:** Integrate the fine-tuned model into a simple web interface for interactive demos.  
* **More Diverse Datasets:** Fine-tune on a broader range of domain-specific datasets for various downstream tasks.  
* **Optimized Training:** Implement techniques like gradient accumulation, mixed-precision training (if not fully utilized), or distributed training for larger models and datasets.
