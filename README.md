# GPT-2-Style-Language-Model-Built-from-Scratch-
Build a GPT-style LLM from scratch with PyTorch. This project covers implementing the transformer architecture, pre-training on a custom corpus, and fine-tuning for classification and instruction-following. It also demonstrates how to load official GPT-2 weights, offering a complete guide to understanding modern LLMs.
